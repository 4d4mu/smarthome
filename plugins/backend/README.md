# Backend GUI

This plugin delivers information about the current SmarthomeNG installation. Right now it serves as a support tool for helping other users with an installation that does not run properly. Some highlights:

* a list of installed python modules is shown versus the available versions from PyPI
* a list of items and their attributes is shown
* a list of logics and their next execution time
* a list of current schedulers and their next execution time
* some information about frequently used daemons like knxd is included

There is however no protection for unauthorized access or use of the plugin so be careful when enabling it with your network.

The plugin might be used standalone as well.

It is still in early development so please give feedback to the community.
